# Linear-Regression-in-SQL
In this exercise we will try to learn how can we implement linear regression just using SQL.


## Table of content
First create the [database](https://github.com/tanaymukherjee/Linear-Regression-in-SQL/blob/master/00_Create%20the%20database%20and%20table.sql) using the raw file before attempting the following:
1. Data for regression
2. Regression coefficients
3. Linear time trend
4. Statistical significance test
5. Orthogonal contrast codes
6. Linear time trend and seasonality

The [R code](https://github.com/tanaymukherjee/Linear-Regression-in-SQL/blob/master/Linear-regression-in-sql.r) file is also shared to do the final analysis and calculating necessary parameters to understand the ouput of the regression from this exercise.


## Data
The data for the experiment is available inside the 'data' folder in this repository. Also, the output from each process outlined above will be shared in the same folder.


## Reading
I came across this idea through an online article via mode.com by Julia Glick. I have uploaded the reading material in the repository for your reading. Given the size of the file, one must download the folder to get access to the file. I don't claim exclusive rights on the technique but this is an impressive take on Statistics using SQL.
