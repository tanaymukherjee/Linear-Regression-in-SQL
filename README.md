# Linear-Regression-in-SQL
In this exercise we will try to learn how can we implement linear regression just using SQL.


## Table of content
1. Data for regression
2. Regression coefficients
3. Linear time trend
4. Statistical significance test
5. Orthogonal contrast codes
6. Linear time trend and seasonality


## Data
The data for the experiment is available inside the 'data' folder in this repository. Also, the output from each process outlined above will be shared in the same folder.


## Reading
I came across this idea through an online article via mode.com by Julia Glick. I have uploaded the reading material in the repository for your reading. Given the size of the file, one must download the folder to get access to the file. I don't claim exclusive rights on the technique but this is an impressive take on Statistics using SQL.
